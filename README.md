# MD-public

My scripts for use in [Memento Database](https://mementodatabase.com/). Unfortunately, it appears that the option to add a JS library via GitHub only works for the root folder, so everything must be put in here.

Since I can't use subfolders, all files will be using a naming convention similar to the subfolder paths that I *would* be using.

#Purpose of these scripts

I am currently reading a very long story. I found the story in a webcomic format, and then later found it in novel format. I am going through the novel, but I remembered that I had difficulty remembering characters and concepts in the comic. Normally, I'd use a fan wiki to keep track, but those are written by people who have finished reading the story and thus contain spoilers that are easy to see even when I'm not looking for them.

So I'm making my own personal "database" to keep track of everything. Further, I'm making it possible to re-use this database when I inevitably reread the story by making multiple versions of the same entries, which populate information in a single generic entry based on what I tell it is the latest chapter that I've read.

For the curious, the webcomic version can be found [here](https://www.webtoons.com/en/action/omniscient-reader/episode-0-prologue/viewer?title_no=2154&episode_no=1). The novel version apparently has some debates regarding translation of names and/or terms, so I recommend looking for it yourself so that you can decide what you would prefer.
