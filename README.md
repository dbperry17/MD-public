# MD-public

My scripts for use in [Memento Database](https://mementodatabase.com/). Unfortunately, it appears that the option to add a JS library via GitHub only works for the root folder, so everything must be put in here.

Since I can't use subfolders, all files will be using a naming convention similar to the subfolder paths that I *would* be using.

Further, Git is not integrated into the app, as far as I can tell, and I typically use it exclusively on my phone anyway, so all updates will unfortunately be manual.

# Purpose of these scripts

I am currently reading a very long story. I found the story in a webcomic format, and then later found it in novel format. I am going through the novel, but I remembered that I had difficulty remembering characters and concepts in the comic. Normally, I'd use a fan wiki to keep track, but those are written by people who have finished reading the story and thus contain spoilers that are easy to see even when I'm not looking for them.

So I'm making my own personal "database" to keep track of everything. Further, I'm making it possible to re-use this database when I inevitably reread the story by making multiple versions of the same entries, which populate information in a single generic entry based on what I tell it is the latest chapter that I've read.

For the curious, the webcomic version can be found [here](https://www.webtoons.com/en/action/omniscient-reader/episode-0-prologue/viewer?title_no=2154&episode_no=1). The novel version apparently has some debates regarding translation of names and/or terms, so I recommend looking for it yourself so that you can decide what you would prefer.

# A note about debugging

Unfortunately, some scripts that worked fine copying and pasting into each library seem to be disliked now that I'm using those same scripts via GitHub. As I am rather new to JavaScript, I am not always immediately able to spot these mistakes. Due to the nature of the "only started misbehaving when switching to GitHub" problem, there's really no way to try and debug these without constantly creating new commits, especially since I've pretty much exclusively used my phone for this due to the nature of the app.

As such, please excuse the messy commit history some of these files may have.
