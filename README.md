My scripts for use in [Memento Database](https://mementodatabase.com/). Unfortunately, Git is not integrated into the app, as far as I can tell, and I typically use it exclusively on my phone anyway, so all updates will unfortunately be manual.

# Purpose of these scripts

I am currently reading a very long story. I found the story in a webcomic format, and then later found it in novel format. I am going through the novel, but I remembered that I had difficulty remembering characters and concepts in the comic. Normally, I'd use a fan wiki to keep track, but those are written by people who have finished reading the story and thus contain spoilers that are easy to see even when I'm not looking for them.

So I'm making my own personal "database" to keep track of everything. Further, I'm making it possible to re-use this database when I inevitably reread the story by making multiple versions of the same entries, which populate information in a single generic entry based on what I tell it is the latest chapter that I've read.

For the curious, the webcomic version can be found [here](https://www.webtoons.com/en/action/omniscient-reader/episode-0-prologue/viewer?title_no=2154&episode_no=1). The novel version apparently has some debates regarding translation of names and/or terms, so I recommend looking for it yourself so that you can decide what you would prefer.

# A note about debugging

This is my first time using a library that is not saved locally. Further, as mentioned above, I almost exclusively use this in the phone version of the app, which does not have git integrated at all.

As a result, altering pretty much anything in the library requires me to make a new commit because that is the only way to save changes to the file.

Further, the lack of integration with Git means that using branches and pull-requests as a way to limit the amount of commits in main is difficult. I have made *some* attempts to solve this, but my main focus remains on getting the code to work rather than have a pretty commit history.

# Current Status

Honestly, I started out seeing if it was possible to do one thing, succeeding, and then seeing if it was possible to do another thing, and then repeating.

At this point, the code is currently not working like I want it to, and I think it may be best to restart from scratch to plan things properly now that I know my end goal.
